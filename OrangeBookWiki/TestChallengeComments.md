## Final Autor TestChallenge Comments
<pre>
Special comments for my experience on development this apps.
I tryed to apply all demanding rules, and soliciting experience:
    - Apply SOLID principles
    - BDD, TTD and Do ATDD
    - The requirements have been kept simple on purpose but
      structure and code the solution as if it were a
      big application
    - The microservice should be auto-contained. 
      Don't depend on any external services being run.
    - Some requirements have been left ambiguous on purpose so,
      if you make any assumption, please add a comment.
    - Java 1.8 or higher.
    - Sping Framework, mvc, boot, data.
    - Continuos Integration (Jenkins)
    - GitHub Repository.
I have had experience as a developer based on Open Source ERP Idempiere. 
Particullary this ERP lacks a litle on Testing procedures, because most java plugin 
development is based on community developed legacy code, started 
on 1999 as Compiere and forked on iDempiere on 2008.
Idempiere is based on Java JPA persistence, making it compatible for Oracle an PostgreSQL. 
So my experience on Hibernate is relatively medium, based as selft-taught and developer curiosity. 
There are some Database validations, that must be done on hibernate project table annotations model. 
Instead of this, i used an script to solve temporaryly some table constrains. 
I recognize it is not a good practice, specially on ORM development.
At this moment I have prepared the structure and development environment
of the test application and I am working to complete it. 
The structure of the application based on an API is defined, the functional tests 
I have done so far with Postman, we can build simple web pages to do tests using a browser.
I have described the tools required to install development and production environment.
The objective of continuous integration has not been addressed in this exercise, 
however the use of mavem simplifyes this approach.
A microservice for Jenkins can be used for this purpose.
Additional Front End HTML-CSS-JS pages will easyly help improve testing on production environment.
It is more than a pleasure to work in a practice like this.
I hope, It likes to you
Best regards,
