# Welcome to TestChallenge wiki!

## Code Challenge
The goal of this code challenge is to create a microservice using Java and any framework that you think it is
appropriate.
## General rules
- Apply SOLID principles
- Do ATDD
- The requirements have been kept simple on purpose but structure and code the solution as if it were a
big application
- The microservice should be auto-contained. Don't depend on any external services being run (ex. if
needed, use an in-memory data storage)
- Some requirements have been left ambiguous on purpose so, if you make any assumption, please add a
comment
